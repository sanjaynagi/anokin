    "# Why AnoKin & Why CKMR?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge: Understanding Mosquito Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Knowledge Gap\n",
    "One of the most significant gaps in our understanding of malaria vectors is surprisingly basic: we don't know how far mosquitoes can fly. This seemingly simple question has major implications for malaria control. Current estimates vary dramatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional studies suggest mosquitoes fly no more than 5km per generation\n",
    "- Recent research in the Sahel and western Kenya indicates mosquitoes may travel much further, carried by wind currents over extremely large distances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Understanding mosquito dispersal is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Control Trials**: To effectively evaluate new control tools like spatial repellents and ATSBs, we need to design robust randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The distance mosquitoes can travel affects how we structure these trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gene Drive Implementation**: Gene drive technology shows promise for malaria control through either:\n",
    "   - Population suppression\n",
    "   - Making vectors refractory to malaria transmission\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Large consortiums like Target Malaria and Zero Transmission are planning field trials by 2028. To model gene drive spread accurately, we must understand mosquito movement patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insecticide Resistance**: The spread of insecticide resistance threatens current control methods. Understanding how mosquitoes move helps us track and predict resistance spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Close-Kin Mark-Recapture (CKMR)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CKMR?\n",
    "Close-kin mark-recapture is an advanced genomic technique that allows us to track mosquito movement without physically marking and recapturing insects. Instead, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample mosquitoes across a defined area\n",
    "2. Sequence their genomes\n",
    "3. Identify related individuals through their DNA\n",
    "4. Use the geographic distance between related mosquitoes to estimate dispersal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why CKMR?\n",
    "CKMR offers several advantages over traditional methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-invasive**: No need to mark mosquitoes, which can affect their behavior\n",
    "- **Comprehensive**: Can detect both short and long-distance movement\n",
    "- **Additional insights**: Beyond dispersal, CKMR can reveal:\n",
    "  - Census population size\n",
    "  - Daily survivorship\n",
    "  - Population dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Genomics\n",
    "While genomics has revolutionized vector surveillance, most advances have focused on insecticide resistance mechanisms. AnoKin takes a novel approach by using genomics to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish familial relationships between mosquitoes\n",
    "- Identify up to 3rd-degree relatives (e.g., cousins)\n",
    "- Create detailed dispersal models based on genetic relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Site\n",
    "We are conducting this work at Lake Kanyaboli, western Kenya, chosen for:\n",
    "- High malaria transmission\n",
    "- Stable *An. funestus* habitat\n",
    "- Existing research infrastructure\n",
    "- Well-characterized wind patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "This project will provide:\n",
    "1. Quantitative estimates of *An. funestus* dispersal distances and rates\n",
    "2. Open-source software for analyzing close-kin genomic data\n",
    "3. Critical data to enhance vector control efforts\n",
    "4. Improved design parameters for future intervention trials\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looking Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from AnoKin will directly inform:\n",
    "- Design of vector control trials\n",
    "- Implementation of gene drive strategies\n",
    "- Management of insecticide resistance\n",
    "- Future vector control tools\n",
    "\n",
    "By filling this critical knowledge gap, we can better target our interventions and work more effectively toward malaria elimination.\n"
