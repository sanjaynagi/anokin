    "# Sampling Protocol for AnoKin\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol describes the sampling procedures for collecting *Anopheles funestus* mosquitoes at Lake Kanyaboli, Kenya, using Prokopack aspirators. For detailed information on Prokopack aspirator use, please refer to the [PacMOSSI Standard Operating Procedure](https://pacmossi.org/carbon/assets/2022/05/PacMOSSI-SOP_Prokopack-1.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Area and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "- Study site: Lake Kanyaboli, Siaya County, western Kenya\n",
    "- Sampling area: ~3km Ã— 3km wedge-shaped area extending from northeastern corner of lake\n",
    "- Area divided into four alternating bands (quadrants)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline\n",
    "- Primary sampling period: 6 days\n",
    "- Buffer period: 5 additional days if needed\n",
    "- Collection times: 06:00 - 10:00 daily\n",
    "- Duration per house: ~25 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equipment Required\n",

    "- Marker pens\n",
    "- Field collection bags\n",
    "- Tablets with ODK software installed\n",
    "- Tablet chargers and power banks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage Materials\n",
    "- 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes\n",
    "- Barcoded plastic storage bags\n",
    "- Silica gel packets\n",
    "- Permanent markers\n",

    "- Basic tool kit\n",
    "- Extra batteries\n",
    "- Power banks/portable chargers\n",
    "- Local maps\n",
    "- Head torches with red lens (~680 nm)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Household Selection Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparation**\n",
    "   - Identify GPS coordinate within assigned quadrant\n",
    "   - Locate four nearest compounds to the coordinate\n",
    "   - Focus on primary sleeping structure in each compound\n",
    "   - Skip minor structures within compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consent Process**\n",
    "   - Visit with two fieldworkers plus community facilitator\n",
    "   - Explain study aims and procedures\n",
    "   - Present consent form and answer questions\n",
    "   - If consent given, record GPS coordinates in ODK\n",
    "   - Inform household to avoid repellents/insecticides night before collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Starting\n",
    "1. Organize and label collection cups for each sampling location\n",
    "2. Assemble Prokopack aspirator following SOP guidelines\n",
    "3. Test aspirator function\n",
    "4. Prepare data collection forms/tablets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indoor Collection Process\n",
    "1. **Room Preparation**\n",
    "   - Close all windows and doors before starting\n",
    "   - Begin at back rooms, working toward front\n",
    "   - For multi-story houses, start upstairs and work down\n",
    "   - Follow left-to-right sequence in each room\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collection Method** (15 minutes per house)\n",
    "   - Hold aspirator within 15cm of surfaces\n",
    "   - Move at approximately 1 meter per second\n",
    "   - Follow systematic pattern:\n",
    "     a. Sample walls vertically, moving clockwise\n",
    "     b. Sample ceilings horizontally\n",
    "     c. Check furniture, especially dark areas\n",
    "     d. Focus on closets, wardrobes, hanging clothes\n",
    "     e. Collect any flying mosquitoes observed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Handling**\n",
    "   - Place collection cup lid before turning off aspirator\n",
    "   - Label cup with:\n",
    "     - House ID (VillageID-houseID-date)\n",
    "     - GPS coordinates\n",
    "     - Collection time\n",
    "     - Collector name\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Recording\n",
    "Use ODK form to record:\n",
    "- Collector Name\n",
    "- Consent status\n",
    "- Date collected\n",
    "- House identifier\n",
    "- GPS coordinates\n",
    "- Wall type\n",
    "- Roof type\n",
    "- Start Time\n",
    "- End Time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Storage**\n",
    "   - Transfer mosquitoes to labeled Eppendorf tubes\n",
    "   - Add silica gel for preservation\n",
    "   - Each tube should contain exactly one mosquito\n",
    "   - Label both tube and lid with unique ID\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Documentation**\n",
    "   - Record sample metadata in ODK\n",
    "   - Take photos of collection site if needed\n",
    "   - Note any unusual circumstances or deviations from protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quality Control\n",
    "- Daily data review by project coordinator\n",
    "- Feedback to teams on sampling coverage\n",
    "- Monitor collection rates across quadrants\n",
    "- Adjust sampling effort if needed to ensure even coverage"
