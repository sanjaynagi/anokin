# Sampling

This protocol describes the sampling procedures for collecting *Anopheles funestus* mosquitoes at Lake Kanyaboli, Kenya, using Prokopack aspirators. For detailed information on Prokopack aspirator use, please refer to the [PacMOSSI Standard Operating Procedure](https://pacmossi.org/carbon/assets/2022/05/PacMOSSI-SOP_Prokopack-1.pdf).

## Study Area and Design

- Study site: Lake Kanyaboli, Siaya County, western Kenya.
- Sampling area: ~3km Ã— 3km wedge-shaped area extending from northeastern corner of lake 
- Sampling points in [Google Earth projects](https://sanjaynagi.github.io/anokin/google-earth)
- [ODK form for collection metadata](https://odkcentral.lstmed.ac.uk/-/single/UuRIN3JbCKdCIP3Z290MVeFuZVkeWxe?st=rXPTZnwQ!Y2lYYeetLWdWEwpwOhaS2ZmsMw!V3RjENH8nUhVtzyz17T1J3WR$ylB)
- Area divided into four alternating bands (quadrants)
  
- Collection times: 06:00 - 10:00 daily
- Duration per house: ~25 minutes (including consent)

## Household Selection Procedure

  1. Identify GPS coordinate (use [Google Earth project](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1vyNvGwcHQtF8beYkGfx1ZbtHXWtlQfxb?usp=sharing))
  2. Locate four nearest compounds to the coordinate
  3. Focus on the primary sleeping structure in each compound. 
  4. Skip minor structures. 
  5. Visit each house with a community health worker and identify the household head.
  6. Explain the study aims and procedures to the household head. Answer any questions
  7. If consent is given, continue with ODK form, recording household head name and GPS coordinates.
  8. Begin sampling when notified by the ODK form.

## Collection Protocol

### Before Starting
1. Organize and label collection cups for each sampling location
2. Assemble Prokopack aspirator following SOP guidelines
3. Test aspirator function
4. Prepare data collection forms/tablets

### Indoor Collection Process
1. **Room Preparation**
   - Begin at back rooms, working towards the  front of the house. 
   - For multi-story houses, start upstairs and work down
   - Follow left-to-right sequence in each room

2. **Collection Method** (15 minutes per house)
   - Hold aspirator within 15cm of surfaces
   - Move at approximately 1 meter per second
   - Follow systematic pattern:
     - Sample walls vertically, moving clockwise
     - Sample ceilings horizontally  
     - Check furniture, especially dark areas  
     - Focus on closets, wardrobes, hanging clothes
     - Collect any flying mosquitoes observed  

3. **Sample Handling**
   - Place collection cup lid before turning off aspirator.
   - If necessary, use a mouth aspirator to transfer mosquitoes from the collection cup to a paper cup.
   - Place the cup into the barcoded plastic bag.
   - Scan the barcode with the tablet (ODK form)
   - Label the bag with the unique household-ID returned by the sampling ODK form. 
   - Seal the bag for transport to the Lwak lab for further processing.
