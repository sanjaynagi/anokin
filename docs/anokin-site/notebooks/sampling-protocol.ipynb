    "# Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol describes the sampling procedures for collecting *Anopheles funestus* mosquitoes at Lake Kanyaboli, Kenya, using Prokopack aspirators. For detailed information on Prokopack aspirator use, please refer to the [PacMOSSI Standard Operating Procedure](https://pacmossi.org/carbon/assets/2022/05/PacMOSSI-SOP_Prokopack-1.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Area and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study site: Lake Kanyaboli, Siaya County, western Kenya.\n",
    "- Sampling area: ~3km Ã— 3km wedge-shaped area extending from northeastern corner of lake \n",
    "- Sampling points in [Google Earth projects](https://sanjaynagi.github.io/anokin/google-earth)\n",
    "- [ODK form for collection metadata](https://odkcentral.lstmed.ac.uk/-/single/UuRIN3JbCKdCIP3Z290MVeFuZVkeWxe?st=rXPTZnwQ!Y2lYYeetLWdWEwpwOhaS2ZmsMw!V3RjENH8nUhVtzyz17T1J3WR$ylB)\n",
    "- Area divided into four alternating bands (quadrants)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Collection times: 06:00 - 10:00 daily\n",
    "- Duration per house: ~25 minutes (including consent)\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. Identify GPS coordinate (use [Google Earth project](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1vyNvGwcHQtF8beYkGfx1ZbtHXWtlQfxb?usp=sharing))\n",
    "  2. Locate four nearest compounds to the coordinate\n",
    "  3. Focus on the primary sleeping structure in each compound. \n",
    "  4. Skip minor structures. \n",
    "  5. Visit each house with a community health worker and identify the household head.\n",
    "  6. Explain the study aims and procedures to the household head. Answer any questions\n",
    "  7. If consent is given, continue with ODK form, recording household head name and GPS coordinates.\n",
    "  8. Begin sampling when notified by the ODK form. \n",

    "## Collection Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Starting\n",
    "1. Organize and label collection cups for each sampling location\n",
    "2. Assemble Prokopack aspirator following SOP guidelines\n",
    "3. Test aspirator function\n",
    "4. Prepare data collection forms/tablets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indoor Collection Process\n",
    "1. **Room Preparation**\n",
    "   - Begin at back rooms, working towards the  front of the house. \n",
    "   - For multi-story houses, start upstairs and work down\n",
    "   - Follow left-to-right sequence in each room\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collection Method** (15 minutes per house)\n",
    "   - Hold aspirator within 15cm of surfaces\n",
    "   - Move at approximately 1 meter per second\n",
    "   - Follow systematic pattern:\n",
    "     - Sample walls vertically, moving clockwise\n",
    "     - Sample ceilings horizontally  \n",
    "     - Check furniture, especially dark areas  \n",
    "     - Focus on closets, wardrobes, hanging clothes\n",
    "     - Collect any flying mosquitoes observed  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Handling**\n",
    "   - Place collection cup lid before turning off aspirator.\n",
    "   - If necessary, use a mouth aspirator to transfer mosquitoes from the collection cup to a paper cup.\n",
    "   - Place the cup into the barcoded plastic bag.\n",
    "   - Scan the barcode with the tablet (ODK form)\n",
    "   - Label the bag with the unique household-ID returned by the sampling ODK form. \n",
    "   - Seal the bag for transport to the Lwak lab for further processing."
