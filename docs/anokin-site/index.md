# AnoKin

Welcome to the AnoKin project website!

AnoKin is a close-kin mark-recapture study of Anopheles mosquitoes in Kenya. The project aims to better understand malaria mosquito dispersal and population structure through genomic analysis of kinship between individual mosquitoes. This website hosts the project protocols and will serve as a repository for results and analyses as they become available. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how we could improve the website, please [get in touch](mailto:sanjay.nagi@lstmed.ac.uk).
